#Performing our first commit

- Make a change
- Add the change
- Commit the change

`git add <changed file>`
`git commit -m <commit message> `


---

## git add

- Add writes to the repository (in a binary object)
- add creates a new copy of a file

---

## Git commit

- Takes what has been written in the repo and creates a commit object for that
- The commit object has an id (hash)
- The commit object has labels on it (head (where you currently created the object), master (branch))
